EECS499
=======

EECS499 is an elective at the University of Michigan that allows students the opportunity to independently learn mobile app development. This document will serve as information and personal log.

Idea
====
For this independent study I will be focussing on iOS development. I will be delving into the applications of the google mapps api, as well as the cocos-2d game framework. What I would like to do is create a driving game, where one has the ability to potentially drive across the country (USA). Additions would include time trials, or a "crazy taxi" like game.

What Came Out
=============
So I finally submitted my final product to my professor. What the game turned out to be was, a crazy taxi game where the player drives from location to location before time runs out and while avoiding different hazards. I concluded that there aren't any viable ways for collisions to take place between a uiview and a building drawn in the maps api. So instead of having cars drive over buildings without reprocusions, I changed the primary vehicle to to a blimp; appropriately named "Mark Mevorah's Led Zeppelin."
