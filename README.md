EECS499
=======

EECS499 is an elective at the University of Michigan that allows students the opportunity to independently learn mobile app development. 

Idea
====
For this independent study I will be focussing on iOS development. I will be delving into the applications of the google mapps api, as well as the cocos-2d game framework. What I would like to do is create a driving game, where one has the ability to potentially drive across the country (USA). Additions would include time trials, or a "crazy taxi" like game.
