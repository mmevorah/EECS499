EECS499
=======

EECS499 is an elective at the University of Michigan that allows students the opportunity to independently learn mobile app development. This document will serve as information and personal log.

Idea
====
For this independent study I will be focussing on iOS development. I will be delving into the applications of the google mapps api, as well as the cocos-2d game framework. What I would like to do is create a driving game, where one has the ability to potentially drive across the country (USA). Additions would include time trials, or a "crazy taxi" like game.

What's Been Done
================
-Re-familiarize myself with Objective-C
-Read and applied the google maps api
-Worked out the game's organization
-Worked out the car's mechanics
-Begun learning and using the cocos-2d framework
-Integrated controlles and the map
-Create a class that handles car information
-manipulate information class and map with cocos 2d buttons

What needs to be done in short term
===================================
-Tweak car mechanics
-Find a better way to rotate and display car

What needs to be done in the mid term
=====================================
-Add restrictions to map via reverse geocoding

What needs to be done in the long term
======================================
-Main menu
-Sound
-Time Trials
