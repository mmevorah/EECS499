EECS499
=======

EECS499 is an elective at the University of Michigan that allows students the opportunity to independently learn mobile app development. This document will serve as information and personal log.

Idea
====
For this independent study I will be focussing on iOS development. I will be delving into the applications of the google mapps api, as well as the cocos-2d game framework. What I would like to do is create a driving game, where one has the ability to potentially drive across the country (USA). Additions would include time trials, or a "crazy taxi" like game.

What's Been Done
================
-Re-familiarize myself with Objective-C

-Read and applied the google maps api

-Worked out the game's organization

-Worked out the car's mechanics

-Integrated controlles and the map

-Create a class that handles car information

-manipulate information class and map with cocoa buttons

-Tweak car mechanics

-Found a better way to rotate and display car

What needs to be done in short term
===================================

-move map with car's movement

What needs to be done in the mid term
=====================================
-Add restrictions to map via reverse geocoding -> changed to using color of pixels instead
  -add crashes to car class update method

What needs to be done in the long term
======================================
-Time Trials
  -gameplay
  -records/saved tracks
-Main menu
  -scroll menu with options
-Sound
  -allow to use ipod/pandora music
  -default sound effects
-Options menu
  -allow to change default sounds
-Spedometer
